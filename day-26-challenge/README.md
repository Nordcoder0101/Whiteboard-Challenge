## 26: Whiteboard Challenge
Requirements
Create a utils.js module that exports the following methods:

map()
filter()
reduce()
Your module should include an implementation of these methods from scratch, not utilizing the built-in array methods.

Submission Instructions
With your assigned partner, pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Take a picture of your proposed solution for your repo.
Make a new branch and folder in your whiteboard challenge repository on GitHub. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of the challenge.
This folder should contain:
A file named util.js which contains the JavaScript solution
A __test__ directory that includes your util.test.js file and associated tests
A picture of your pseudocoded solution from the whiteboarding exercise
A README.md which includes the problem domain
Complete the whiteboard challenge in your text editor, and verify that it's functional
Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch
