# 27: Whiteboard Challenge
## Requirements
Create a stack.js module that contains a stack constructor and the following methods:

push - pushes an element onto the stack
pop - removes an element from the stack
peek - gets the top element of the stack
getMin - gets the minimum element in the stack - this should work for positive and negative values
Note: Your stack implementation may be created using the class syntax, if you choose.

Submission Instructions
With your assigned partner, pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Take a picture of your proposed solution for your repo.
Make a new branch and folder in your whiteboard challenge repository on GitHub. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of the challenge.
This folder should contain:
A file named stack.js which contains the JavaScript solution
A __test__ directory that includes your stack.test.js file and associated tests
A picture of your pseudocoded solution from the whiteboarding exercise
A README.md which includes the problem domain
Complete the whiteboard challenge in your text editor, and verify that it's functional
Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch
